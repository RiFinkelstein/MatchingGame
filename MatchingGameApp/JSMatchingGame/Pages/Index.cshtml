    <h2>🧠 Game Description</h2>
    <p>
        The Matching Game is a simple memory game designed for two players. There are 16 cards on the board:
        8 pink cards and 8 blue cards. Each card hides a symbol. The goal is to find matching pairs by flipping one pink and one blue card during your turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the two cards match, they stay revealed and you get another turn. If not, they flip back and it's the other player's turn. The game continues until all pairs are found. The player with the most matches wins!
    </p>
