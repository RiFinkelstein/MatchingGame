# Matching Game

## Overview
This documentation describes the requirements for the software implementation of the classic matching game. This software allows two players to play against each other or for one player to play against the computer. A description of the game and the requirements of this implementation are provided below.

## The Game
Two players are presented with a 5x5 grid of ‘flipped over cards’. The players take turns choosing 2 cards at a time to see if they have a matching picture. If the 2 cards match, a point is given to the player who chose the cards, and the ‘cards’ remain with the picture showing. If the pictures are not the same, the ‘cards’ are flipped back over.

**The spec for the game is in the repo**
